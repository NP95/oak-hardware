# Project Oak Hardware Development

This repository contains code for circuits and verification related to
Project Oak.

One of the [experiments](kami) in this repo is an attempt to use the [Kami](https://github.com/mit-plv/kami) system to define a simple counter circuit and drive the implementation process all the way from Kami/Coq via Bluespec to Verilog and then using the Vivado Xilinx FPGA tools to produce a running demo on the Xilinx
[ZCU104](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/zcu104.htm) development board.
